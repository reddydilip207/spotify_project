## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced). The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```sql

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotify;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Artist)
FROM spotify;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Album)
FROM spotify;

SELECT DISTINCT Album_type
FROM spotify;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Title) 
FROM spotify;	

SELECT DISTINCT channel
FROM spotify;

SELECT DISTINCT most_played_on
FROM spotify;

SELECT MAX(duration_min)
FROM spotify;

SELECT MIN(duration_min)
FROM spotify;

SELECT *
FROM spotify
WHERE duration_min =0;

DELETE FROM spotify
WHERE duration_min =0;
```
### 2. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **Basic**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Basic Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions

#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs.

## 15 Practice Questions

### Easy Level
1. **Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM spotify
WHERE stream > 1000000000;
```
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
```sql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT Album,
	Artist
FROM spotify
ORDER BY 1;
```
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(comments) AS total_comments
FROM spotify
WHERE licensed = 'true'
```
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM spotify
WHERE album_type='single';
```
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
```sql
SELECT 
	Artist,
	COUNT(*) AS total_number
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2;
```
### Medium Level
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
```sql
SELECT 
	Album,
	AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
```sql
SELECT 
	track,
	MAX(energy) AS highest_energy
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
```sql
SELECT 
	track,
	views,
	likes
FROM spotify
WHERE official_video = 'true'
```
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
```sql
SELECT 
	Album,
	track,
	SUM(views) AS total_views
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM(
SELECT 
	track,
	COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on ='Youtube' THEN stream END),0) AS streamed_on_youtube,
	COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on ='Spotify' THEN stream END),0) AS streamed_on_spotify
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)t1
WHERE streamed_on_spotify>streamed_on_youtube
AND streamed_on_youtube <>0;
```
### Advanced Level
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
```sql
WITH ranking_artist AS(
SELECT 
	artist,
	track,
	SUM(views) AS total_views,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) AS rnk
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,3 DESC
) 
SELECT *
FROM ranking_artist
WHERE rnk <=3;
```
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
```sql
SELECT 
	track,
	artist,
	liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE liveness> (SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);
```
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql
WITH CTE AS(
SELECT 
	Album,
	MAX(energy) AS highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) AS lowest_energy
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy-lowest_energy AS energy_diff
FROM CTE
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
   
4. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
```sql
with track_ratios AS(
SELECT 
	track,
	energy,
	liveness,
	(energy/liveness) AS energy_to_liveness
FROM spotify
)
SELECT *
FROM track_ratios
WHERE (energy/liveness) >1.2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```  
5. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
```sql
SELECT 
	track,
	views,
	likes,
	SUM(likes) OVER(ORDER BY views DESC) AS cumulative_likes_artist
FROM spotify
ORDER BY Views DESC;
```
